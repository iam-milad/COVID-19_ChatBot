What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of:
- a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature); OR
- a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual); OR
- a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste;"
What does self-isolation mean,Stay at home and ask friends or family members to bring you things you need such as medication and groceries or use delivery services for shopping which must be left outside your home for you to collect;
Is there any treatment for COVID-19?,"There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19. Antibiotics do not help as they do not work against viruses. You can ease the symptoms at home until you recover by:
- getting plenty of rest;
- drinking water to keep yourself hydrated – you should drink enough to ensure your urine (pee) is a pale, clear colour;
- use over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol to help with some of your symptoms. Make sure you follow manufacturer’s instructions and do not exceed the recommended dose."
Should I wear a face covering mask?,You should use face coverings in particular circumstances ­- short periods in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not possible.
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?,"Currently there is no vaccine to prevent or treat COVID-19. Those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalised. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation and are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.
As always clean your hands by washing with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub and avoid touching your face."
How do I stay safe while being physically active during COVID-19?,"it is important to keep active during this time. When you go outdoors for physical activity ensure you stay two metres (6 feet) apart from people who are not part of your household at all times.
This advice excludes those who are in high clinical risk groups, or in houses where someone has symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"There is an issue around the capacity for pets to carry the virus on their fur or skin, as with any other surface. The World Health Organization (WHO) states you should wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. Therefore to keep you and your pet safe minimise potential exposure to the virus by washing your hands after handling pets and isolating pets if someone in your household shows symptoms of COVID-19. "
Can I make an appointment with my dentist?,"During the COVID-19 outbreak most dentists will not operate as they would normally so you should:
- call your dentist first;
- your dentist or staff in the dental practice will ask you some questions over the phone to assess your condition. Some of these questions may include if you have a temperature or a cough;
- if appropriate, you may receive a call back from a dentist, be given relevant advice, issued with a prescription or asked to come into the practice."
