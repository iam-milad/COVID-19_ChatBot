# Project Description
A COVID-19 chatbot designed explicitly for COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Four different AI techniques have been used to implemenet the chatbot, which are:
+ **Rule and Similarity based**: used to help users get the optimal answer for their questions regarding COVID-19 via written or spoken chat. 
+ **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: it is used for image classification and live face detection with and without face mask through webcam.
+ **Logical Knowledge Base**: allow users to add new knowledge as well as query the knowledge base. New knowledge can be added to the knowledge base explicitly or it can be deduced from the existing facts using inference rules.
+ **Cloud-based Multi-lingual**: this component is added to the chatbot to allow users ask the chatbot questions regarding COVID-19 in their preferred language. Note: you need Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services endpoint and key for this to work.
